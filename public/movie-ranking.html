<h1>The Best Movies According to Bezel</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>I love the storyline of how a man did everything he could to take care of his son and never gave up even when things were not going his way.</p>

<p>It also teaches us about perceviarance and how not giving up on what you believe in will pay off in the end</p>


<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
<p>Such a hilarious movie and keeps you laughing throughout the movie.</p>

<h3>The Upside</h3>
<p>It just reminds me how people can easily get along and have a meaningful friendship regarless of their economical and/or cultural diferences.</p>
